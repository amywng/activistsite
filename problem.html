          <h1>WHAT</h1>
          <img src="assets/earth.jpg" alt="Picture of Earth from space">
          <p>For more than a century, our planet's climate has been changing. Global warming has taken place which has caused oceans to warm, sea levels to rise, and glaciers to shrink. The change in atmospheric and ocean temperature have also had immense effects on wildlife, taking away many existable habitats and causing species extinctions. Scientific evidence shows that this climage change is mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.</p>

          <h1>WHO</h1>
          <img src="assets/people.jpg" alt="Baby's hand holding elderly's hand">
          <p>Climate change affects all of us, but there are specific groups of people who are most affected. This includes people who live in poverty, as they can't relocate/evacuate, deal with the heat, or afford the increasing price of food. Elderly people and young children are also most vulnerable because of their different immune systems and dependency on other people. Communities of color are also affected more because they are more likely to live near risk-prone areas and interact with dangerous chemicals. Finally, the next generations are in great danger if little to no action is done because their living conditions, health, and food availability are likely to deteriorate.</p>

          <img src="assets/smoke.jpg" alt="Smoke from factory polluting the air">
          <p>The climate has been changing (in an unnatural way) for many decades due to human activities. Things like fossil fuel burning and land-use changes (like deforestation) cause the atmosphere to change, raising our planet's surface temperature.</p>

          <p id="when">Many of these changes have happened in recent history because the Industrial Revolution transformed many of our interactions with the environment.</p>

          <p>The 5 countries most affected by climate change in the 21st century are Puerto Rico, Haiti, Pakistan, Myanmar, and the Philippines. These countries have had devastating climate change-induced natural events occur that have been hard to recover from.
